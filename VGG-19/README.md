|[Natural Images](vgg19-natural-images-classification.ipynb)      | ipynb file with working for training model for classfying Natural images in 8 classes; *motorbike, airplane, flower, dog, fruit, car, cat, person*. The model is trained in kaggle notebook since it is the only place I could get GPU|
|[Fruits Classification](fruits.ipynb)                            | File with working on fruits classification. To test the working of the model, I used [unseen data](./unseen_data.zip)                                                              |
